## Project 1: SAS Optimization Challenge 
* My group was tasked with solving a water supply optimization problem. 
* First, we used Python (pandas, datetime, matplotlib) to forecast the necessary water supply.
* Next, we uses SAS optimization software (optmodel) to determine the most efficient water supply distribution.
